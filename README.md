Hello friends!

I am GabriÃ«lle AKA Tiger, a young developer from a small country called The Netherlands. I started coding when I was around 14 years old.
I work as webdeveloper at a company (internally), however I specialize in multiple areas.

A few languages I'm (semi) good at:
- Java
- PHP
- C#
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Python

I hope someday to learn more languages, because it's really fun to learn new stuff!
Also, I'm a big Arch Linux lover, and prefer using Linux over Windows (especially for development).

If any would like to contact me (for whatever reason), here's a few ways
